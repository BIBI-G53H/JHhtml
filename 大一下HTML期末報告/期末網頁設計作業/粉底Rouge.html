<a1>History</a1><br>
<a2>The Ancient Egyptians were known for their creation of<br>
cosmetics, particularly their use of rouge. Ancient<br>
Egyptian pictographs show men and women wearing<br>
lip and cheek rouge. They blended fat with red<br>
ochre to create a stain that was red in color.<br><br>
Greek men and women eventually mimicked the look,<br>
using crushed mulberries, red beet juice, crushed<br>
strawberries,or red amaranth to create a paste.<br>
Those who wore makeup were viewed as wealthy and<br>
it symbolized status because cosmetics were costly.<br><br>
In China, Rouge was used as early as the Shang Dynasty.<br>
It was made from the extracted juice of leaves from red<br>
and blue flowers. Some people added bovine pulp and pig<br>
pancreas to make the product denser. Women would wear<br>
the heavy rouge on their cheeks and lips. In Chinese<br>
culture, red symbolizes good luck and happiness to those<br>
who wear the color.

<a3>Contemporary</a3><br>
<a4>Modern rouge generally consists of a red-colored<br>
talcum-based powder that is applied with a brush to the<br>
cheeks to accentuate the bone structure. The coloring is<br>
usually either the petals of safflower, or a solution of<br>
carmine in ammonium hydroxide and rosewater perfumed<br>
with rose oil. A cream-based variant of rouge is schnouda,<br>
a colorless mixture of Alloxan with cold cream, which<br>
also colors the skin red.<br><br>
Today, rouge is a term used to primarily identify blush<br>
of any color, including: brown, pink, red, and orange.<br>
It is not commonly used to identify lipstick, however,<br>
some may use the term to refer to the red color of the<br>
product.
